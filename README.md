# Quadcopter Design and Motion Analysis

## Description
This project involves the design and assembly of a quadcopter using SolidWorks. The project includes custom-designed parts such as the frame, battery, motor, and circuit. Additionally, a motion analysis with gravity was performed to simulate the quadcopter's behavior.

## Tools & Versions
- **SolidWorks Version**: 2021
- **Add-ins Used**: Motion Analysis

## File Structure
- `Parts/`: Contains all the custom-designed parts (`.SLDPRT` files)
- `Assembly/`: Contains the full assembly of the quadcopter (`.SLDASM` file)
- `MotionAnalysis/`: Contains the motion analysis study with gravity (`.SLDASM` file)

## How to Use
1. **Open the Parts**: Open the `.SLDPRT` files in the `Parts/` folder to view individual components.
2. **Open the Assembly**: Open the `.SLDASM` file in the `Assembly/` folder to view the full assembly of the quadcopter.
3. **Run Motion Analysis**: Open the `.SLDASM` file in the `MotionAnalysis/` folder and run the motion analysis study to simulate the quadcopter's behavior with gravity.
